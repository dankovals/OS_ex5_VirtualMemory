To run the project you can use the attached cpp file SimpleTest, or to write new tests.
This project make mapping between phisycal adresses to virtual adresses.
We use cpp Vectors to simulate the physical memory (sizes can be changed in MemoryConstants.h),
and hierarchical page tables to map between the virtual memory to the simulated Physical memory.
